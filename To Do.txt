predict star formation variables (sSFR, SFR, M*, age) based on visual morphology (galaxy image)
predict star formation history (SFR at all times) based on visual morphology (galaxy image) or spectral datacubes (cube.flux).


To do:
-Go back to model 2 and try to fix the linearity problem first (i.e no discrete steps), and then play with non-linear activations
to account for the non linear scatter 

-Prep the data properly for the CNN. Use dataloaders, may take a while 
-To make ImageFolder function be easy to index take the plate-ifu from table and put them in alphanumerical order
as that is how ImageFolder goes about its indexing
