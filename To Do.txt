Long Term Project Goals:
predict star formation variables (sSFR, SFR, M*, age) based on visual morphology (galaxy image)
predict star formation history (SFR at all times) based on visual morphology (galaxy image) or spectral datacubes (cube.flux).

   

-make summary plots - maybe show a batch of images with their manga_id, true SFR, predicted SFR and redshift written on the image.


few things to try before tweaking the network architecture:

add the R^2 or MSE to the plots - that'll really help quantify everything - and maybe start putting together a table where you record these so that you can go back later and see exactly what changing different things does (and maybe a plt.savefig() at the end so that the files automatically get saved when you generate them).
what's the effect of varying batch size? i would like us to understand that better and maybe converge on an optimal batch size.

get the summary figure up and running - true & predicted SFR for ~6-10 galaxies - that'll be a really good diagnostic in the long run. 
how do the galaxies look for (i) randomly sampled subsets, (ii) the best SFR reconstructions, and (iii) the worst SFR reconstructions

how does the network behave for mass and sersic instead of / in addition to SFR? does it do better or worse for each of these things?
