predict single morphology variable (sersic) based on multiple star-formation variables (M*, SFR and more)
predict star formation variables (sSFR, SFR, M*, age) based on visual morphology (galaxy image)
predict star formation history (SFR at all times) based on visual morphology (galaxy image) or spectral datacubes (cube.flux).


To do:
-Try and get rid of the activation function plane being created in the data 
    -Rescale data (Done)
    -Play around with hyperparameters (hidden size, learning rate, epochs) (Done)
    -Play around with layers, both number of layers and types of layers
