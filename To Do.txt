Long Term Project Goals:
predict star formation variables (sSFR, SFR, M*, age) based on visual morphology (galaxy image)
predict star formation history (SFR at all times) based on visual morphology (galaxy image) or spectral datacubes (cube.flux).


Completed:
-check effects of the +1 to initial images - does removing this change the results - does it make things better or worse?
    Had no effect on the training 


To do:
-check true vs predicted SFR, M*, sersic. Starting with making sure SFR works first before trying other variables 
-Make train and test plots that compare predicted SFR to true SFR to check how the network is preforming 
    -Make list holding these values into proper arrays
    -Maybe modify the network arch   



-make summary plots - maybe show a batch of images with their manga_id, true SFR, predicted SFR and redshift written on the image.
