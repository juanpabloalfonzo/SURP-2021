predict star formation variables (sSFR, SFR, M*, age) based on visual morphology (galaxy image)
predict star formation history (SFR at all times) based on visual morphology (galaxy image) or spectral datacubes (cube.flux).


To do:
-Prep the data properly for the CNN. Where to put all the images? One combined directory? Leave it as is in SAS
and find a way to have the code call the right directory everytime it needs it 

-Build the actual CNN
