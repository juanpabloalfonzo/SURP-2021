Generalize what I have for x number of inputs, n is still the label (for morphological reference)


Relud activation function (check bookmarks)

4 levels of increasing complexity:
predict single morphology variable (sersic) based on star-formation variable (sSFR)
predict single morphology variable (sersic) based on multiple star-formation variables (M*, SFR and more)
predict star formation variables (sSFR, SFR, M*, age) based on visual morphology (galaxy image)
predict star formation history (SFR at all times) based on visual morphology (galaxy image) or spectral datacubes (cube.flux).
